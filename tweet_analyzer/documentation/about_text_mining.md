# About text mining
## About this file
The purpose of this file is to get a better understanding about the many different aspects of text analysis.
The goal is to apply the newly gained knowledge on some tweets which the twitter bot gathers to hopefully 
arrive at interesting insights about what people like to read from different political people.

## Text mining
### What is text mining
Text mining is the use of algorithms to derive high-quality information of a given set of texts.
A term which also get's thrown around much in this field is the so called data mining.
The difference between data mining and text mining is, that __data mining is designed to deal with structured text like XML while text mining's goal is to deal with unstructured text (like tweets)__
There are many different forms of text mining, but what is very interesting for this particular project is
the so called [concept mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_mining).

### What is concept mining
Concept mining is the mapping of words to concepts. It pays atention to the "meaning" of a
text rather than just statistically analysing it's words.
As you may've guessed this involves arificial intelligence.

This means, I think (I'm rather new to this topic and this quote is from a research paper),
that just because a word get's thrown around a lot in a sentence, doesn't necessarely mean, that
this word represents the "meaning" of a sentence the best.
